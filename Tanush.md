# Bug Fixes and UI Enhancements

After analyzing the application across both frontend and backend components, I've identified several issues and made comprehensive improvements to ensure functionality and visual appeal.

## 1. Backend Issues in `quiz.py`

### Problem 1.1: Always returning the same question
The `get_question()` endpoint always returns question #1 instead of selecting a random question:
```python
@router.get("/question")
async def get_question():
    question = questions[1]  # Always returns the second question (index 1)
    return {...}
```

### Problem 1.2: HTTP Method Mismatch
The answer submission endpoint uses GET instead of POST:
```python
@router.get("/answer")  # Should be @router.post("/answer")
```

### Problem 1.3: Data Retrieval Method
The answer endpoint expects to receive data as a parameter but doesn't properly parse POST body data:
```python
async def submit_answer(data: dict):  # Won't work with POST request body
```

### Solution 1: Backend Fixes
Modified `quiz.py` to:
1. Return a random question using `random.choice(questions)`
2. Change the answer endpoint to use POST method with `@router.post("/answer")`
3. Update the parameter extraction to use FastAPI's Body for proper parsing:
   ```python
   async def submit_answer(
       id: int = Body(...),
       answer: str = Body(...),
       score: int = Body(...)
   )
   ```
4. Added proper router prefix `/quiz` to match frontend requests

## 2. Frontend Issues in `quiz.js`

### Problem 2.1: Endpoint Path Mismatch
Frontend makes a POST request but the backend expects a GET request:
```javascript
fetch(`${BASE_URL}/quiz/answer`, {
  method: "POST", 
  // ...
})
```

### Problem 2.2: Double Request Issue
The updated code was making two separate requests - one initial request without data and a second with query parameters.

### Solution 2: Frontend Fixes
Fixed `quiz.js` to:
1. Keep the POST method to match the updated backend
2. Send the data in the request body as JSON
3. Remove the redundant second request
4. Add better error handling with console logging

## 3. Navigation and Structural Issues

### Problem 3.1: Navigation Inconsistency
Navigation menu across HTML files was inconsistent:
- `index.html`, `items.html` and `profile.html` had consistent navigation after fixes
- `quiz.html` was missing "Analytics" and "News" links (fixed earlier)
- `analytics.html` was completely missing the navigation bar
- `news.html` was missing the "Quiz" link

### Problem 3.2: Missing Container in items.html
The items.html page was missing the container div, causing layout issues:
```html
<!-- Missing container div -->
<script src="scripts/items.js"></script>
```

### Problem 3.3: Incorrect Script Path in profile.html
The profile.html file had an incorrect path to the JavaScript file:
```html
<script src="styles/profile.js"></script> <!-- Incorrect path -->
```

### Solution 3: HTML Structure Fixes
1. Added consistent navigation to all HTML pages:
   - Added missing navigation bar to `analytics.html`
   - Added "Quiz" link to `news.html` navigation
   - Ensured all pages have the same navigation structure
2. Added missing container div to items.html with proper structure
3. Fixed script path in profile.html to use the correct directory:
   ```html
   <script src="scripts/profile.js"></script>
   ```
4. Enhanced index.html with better structured content sections

## 4. UI Enhancement with CSS

### Problem 4
The application lacked consistent styling and visual appeal, potentially affecting user experience.

### Solution 4
Created a comprehensive CSS file with:

1. **Modern Design Language:**
   - Clean, flat design with subtle shadows and rounded corners
   - Consistent color scheme with primary, secondary, and accent colors
   - Responsive layout for various screen sizes

2. **Interactive Elements:**
   - Hover effects on buttons, cards, and navigation items
   - Smooth transitions for a polished feel
   - Transform effects for interactive card elements

3. **Page-Specific Styling:**
   - Quiz: Clearly distinguished questions and answer options
   - Analytics: Card-based statistics with hover effects
   - Items: Grid layout with responsive card design
   - News: Scrollable news feed with individual article cards
   - Profiles: Clean list with proper spacing and actions
   - Home: Sectioned content for better information hierarchy

4. **Accessibility and UX Improvements:**
   - Consistent form styling across the application
   - Custom scrollbars for better usability
   - Clear visual feedback for all interactive elements
   - Mobile-responsive design for all pages

## Summary of Changes

   - Modified question endpoint to return random questions
   - Changed answer endpoint from GET to POST
   - Updated parameter handling to use Body for POST requests
   - Fixed router prefix to be "/quiz"

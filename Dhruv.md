Items.js:

-- Appliction/json instead of application/html [BUG]
-- DELETE instead of POST in function name deleteItem [BUG]

db.py:

-- Made the function async and added await for the ping command [BUG]

-- Properly documented the return type and exceptions in the docstring [NOT_BUG]

-- Included the client in the returned dictionary to allow for proper cleanup by the caller [NOT_BUG]

-- Added client cleanup in the exception handler [MAYBE_BUG]

-- Removed the inconsistent error handling (now just logs and re-raises) [MAYBE_BUG]

-- Ensured the function always either returns the collections dict or raises an exception [NOT_BUG]
